I started building web applications in my first job using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap),
and JQuery. That's it! It was back in 2018. I was a part of the team that used
to build financial and event dashboards for our clients.

It had all possible web components like chartss, tables, maps, and carousels. We
used a lot of third party libraries like Chart.js, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The
code was very modular and easy to maintain. But the biggest problem was
_duplciation_. We had to copy and paste the same code in multiple places.

We sensed a component based architecture was needed. We started to build a
component library. The team was familiar with Angular and React. But we went
ahead with React because of the one way data flow and component composition
patterns.

## The OG Boilerplate

I didn't have any say in the choice of the libraries used in the boilerplate as
I was new to React. I call this OG boilerplate, as this is still more or less
the standard boilerplate in many big corporate react applications.

1. Bootstrapped using
   [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
2. Routing enabled by
   [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) v5
3. Styling and Components base using:
   - [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)
   - [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
4. State management using [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
5. Testing using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and
   [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
6. Bundling using [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)

I later added linting using [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)to the mix. We didn't use
TypeScript but we had [PropTypes](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) for
type checking.

## The Most Used Boilerplate

As I was learning React at job, I started building many side projects by
following many online tutorials, and the thing about me is I like to play around
with tech stack choices as I follow along a tutorial. Hence I decided to build a
boilerplate that I could use to build my own projects. I also wanted to have a
boilerplate that was easy to maintain and extend.

This was back in early 2020, hence mostly resembles the OG boilerplate. But the
noticable deviation was the use of
[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in the project. My state
management approach was overhauled to separate out server cache and application
state thanks to my one of the all time favourite articles on the subject
[Application State Management with React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react)
by none other than [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds).

1. Bootstrapped using
   [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
2. Routing enabled by
   [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) v6
3. Styling and Components base using:
   - [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui)
   - [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)
4. State management using [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
5. Testing using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and
   [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)

I must mention that I am one of the early adopters of
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) inspired by the article of
[CSS Utility Classes and "Separation of Concerns"](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/)
by Adam Wathan. However it still didn't make it into the boilerplate as it was
go to choice for buidling quick websites but I was dependent on component
libraries for getting the job done.

## The Transition Boilerplate

In 2021, I decided to take a step back and re-evaluate the boilerplate. This is
when I was assigned to build the design system for my company. Headless
component libraries like [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/) and
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) were gaining traction.

I was extensively using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v9 for my personal
projects, and was a big fan of the file based routing. This was also the time I
overhauled the OG stack to start using the more modern approach to building
React applications and started leveraging Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static
Site Generation (SSG) made popular by Next.js.

1. Bootstrapped using [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
2. Routing enabled by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)
3. Styling and Components base using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- In house components build on top of [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/)
- and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

4. State management using [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
5. Testing using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and
   [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and
   [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end to end testing

## The Ultimate Boilerplate

I have changed two jobs in the last three years. Worked in a react native
project, went back to using Redux (made easier by
[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)).

Meantime, React has finally moved the
[new documentation site](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) out
from beta which saw a slow death of
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is now the _official_ choice to scaffold a
production-grade React application.

I have tried [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) but found it to be a bit too
opinionated and not the right fit for my needs. I got my hands on
[Remix](https://remix.run/) as soon they went open source and I was hooked by
their _right_ approach to building web applications. I infacted advocated to use
it in my job but it didn't turn out well due to the steep learning curve and the
lack of community support. The new developers in the team were not familiar with
some of the opiniated approach of Remix.

This made me realise there is no perfect boilerplate and I have to pick the
right tools for the job keeping in mind the team and maintainability. Avoid
revamping the boilerplate as soon there is a new hot react meta framework out
there. However if I have to make a choice now, I will go with:

1. Bootstrapped using:

- [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) if my team is
  familiar with Next.js
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) if my team is not familiar with any meta framework
- [Remix](https://remix.run/) for personal projects and a team that is familiar
  with the web platform

2. Routing enabled by

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) for Next.js apps
- [Remix](https://remix.run/) for remix apps
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) for vite apps

3. Styling and Components base using:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) my absolute favourite
- [Shadcn UI](https://shadcn.com/ui) the hottest UI library right now
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for accessibile base components

4. State management using

- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) the undisputed king of state
  management
- [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) coupled with Context Providers for application
  states

5. Testing using

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and
  [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for unit, and integration
  testing
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end to end testing
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) for mocking API calls

6. Form management using

- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form utilities
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for schema validation

7. Misc:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky) for making API calls
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) for date manipulation
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for component documentation
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment
