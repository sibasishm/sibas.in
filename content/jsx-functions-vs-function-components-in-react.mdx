Hey there! If you've ever paired-programmed, code-reviewed, or just stumbled
through someone else's React code, you've probably seen this little gotcha:
calling your component like a regular function. It seems innocent, right? But
behind the scenes, you're chopping out React's magic.

In this post, you'll learn:

- How React decides ‚Äúthis is a component‚Äù vs. ‚Äújust a function‚Äù

- What you lose when you bypass React's render pipeline

- Common anti-patterns and their fixes

- Best practices to keep your abstractions React-friendly

### Peek Under the Hood: `React.createElement`

You know JSX is just
[syntax sugar](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement). Under it all
lives `React.createElement`:

```ts
React.createElement(
	type, // string tag or your function/class
	props, // attributes + children
	...children
);
```

That returns a `ReactElement`: a plain object describing what you want. But it's
React's reconciler that turns that object into real DOM, handles hooks, tracks
updates‚Ä¶ all that good stuff.

So:

- JSX ‚Üí createElement ‚Üí ReactElement ‚Üí \[Reconciler steps] ‚Üí DOM
- Manual call ‚Üí ReactElement ‚Üí üì¥ no reconciler

### Reconciler 101: How React Runs Your Code

Let's start simple. You write:

```js
function Hello() {
	return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
}
```

Here's what happens when React sees `<Hello />`:

1. **Element Creation**: `createElement` gives React a description.
2. **Fiber Allocation**: React makes fiber nodes for each element.
3. **Hook Setup**: React assigns a hook dispatcher so inside your component
   `useState` actually hooks into those fibers.
4. **Render Phase**: React invokes your component, builds the tree, then diffs
   it against the last one.
5. **Commit Phase**: React updates the DOM, runs effects, etc.

If you `Hello()` yourself, you zip past all those steps. No fiber, no hook
wiring, no context. You're flying blind.

### That Moment You Realize You Screwed Up‚Ä¶

Ever written an HOC or render-prop utility? Standard pattern:

```js
function withLogger(Component) {
	return function Wrapped(props) {
		console.log('Rendering', Component.name);
		return Component(props); // ‚Üê oops!
	};
}
```

Boom‚Äîno hooks, no context. It still returns JSX, but React never saw a
`<Wrapped />`.

**Quick fix**:

```js
function withLogger(Component) {
	return function Wrapped(props) {
		console.log('Rendering', Component.name);
		return <Component {...props} />;
	};
}
```

Little change, big difference.

### Pro Tips to Stay in React's Good Books

1. **Name your utils different**: `renderTooltip()` vs `Tooltip`.
2. **Always use JSX for components**:

   ```js
   // ‚úÖ Good
   return <MyComponent foo={bar} />;

   // ‚ùå Bad
   return MyComponent({ foo: bar });
   ```

3. **ESLint to the rescue**: consider a rule blocking direct calls to PascalCase
   functions.
4. **Docs are your friend**: clearly label if a function is just a renderer vs a
   full-blown component.

### Wrapping Up

Next time you're about to type `MyComponent(props)`, pause. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúDo I
want React's lifecycle, hooks, context, suspense, error boundaries?‚Äù If yes‚Äîuse
`<MyComponent />`. If no, maybe rethink whether you really need a component at
all.

Keep it declarative. Let React steer the ship.
