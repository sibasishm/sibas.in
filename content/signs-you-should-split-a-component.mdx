React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A
React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup.
Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

I have seen many React developers who have a hard time splitting a component
into smaller components. They tend to build a component that is too big, and
then refactor it later. While some tend to follow some made-up rule of thumb
like "Three props is fine. Five props is a code smell. More than seven props is
a disaster." or my personal favourite "If you have more than 200 lines of code,
you probably need to refactor." or my personal favorite."

In the process, we often end up with wrong abstractions that are _harder_ to
understand and maintain.

## AHA Programming

Like all novice programmers, I was hard wired to the
[DRY (an acronym for "Don't Repeat Yourself")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
principle. This is generally a good practice and prevents us from fixing a bug
in multiple places. But in the process of avoiding duplication at any cost, we
need of with what [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz) calls the
[The Wrong Abstraction](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)
problem.

I was introduced to this concept by
[Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) in his talk
[AHA Programming](https://youtu.be/wuVy7rwkCfc?si=EC8oQKi_eicJ66or). The biggest
takeaway from this talk is that you shouldn't be dogmatic about when you start
writing abstractions but instead write the abstraction when it feels right and
don't be afraid to duplicate code until you get there.

## The Signs You Should Split a Component

Now that you are clear on _not_ to split a component too early, let's look at
the signs you should actually split a component:

- The props are complicated and confusing
- Different prop combinations are needed for different use cases
- There are too many _optional_ props
- The prop combinations are _illogical_
- The component is expensive to render
