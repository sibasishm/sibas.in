TypeScript unions let us create types that can hold values from different
specified types. However, working with union types can feel like juggling --
fun, but challenging. Let's explore some of these challenges and how we can turn
them into opportunities to write cleaner and safer code.

### Challenges and Limitations of Union Types

1. Type Safety Across Unions: TypeScript ensures operations are valid for every
   member of a union. This means you can't directly use properties or methods
   specific to only some types in the union without doing some detective work
   first.

2. Compile-time Known Types: Union types are based on types known at compile
   time. This can feel a bit restrictive in scenarios where types might change
   dynamically at runtime.

### Type Guards: Your Safety Net

Type guards are like your safety net, ensuring you don't fall flat when working
with unions:

```typescript
type UserId = string | number;

function formatId(id: UserId): string {
	if (typeof id === 'string') {
		return id.toUpperCase();
	}
	return id.toString();
}
```

In this example, `typeof` acts as a type guard, helping TypeScript narrow down
the union type based on runtime checks. This way, TypeScript can figure out the
correct type within the function block.

### Conditional Types: The Shape-Shifters

When dealing with dynamically determined types, conditional types are like
shape-shifters, adapting to the situation:

```typescript
interface Cat {
	name: string;
	age: number;
	color: string;
}

interface Dog {
	name: string;
	age: number;
	breed: string;
}

type Animal = Cat | Dog;

const animals: Animal[] = [
	{
		name: 'Fluffy',
		age: 2,
		color: 'white',
	},
	{
		name: 'Fido',
		age: 3,
		breed: 'Labrador',
	},
];

animals.map(animal => {
	if ('breed' in animal) {
		// TypeScript knows `animal` is a Dog here
		return animal.breed;
	} else {
		// TypeScript knows `animal` is a Cat here
		return animal.color;
	}
});
```

Here, the `in` operator acts as a type guard within the `map()` function,
allowing TypeScript to infer whether `animal` is a `Cat` or a `Dog` based on the
presence of the `breed` property. This ensures type-specific operations without
any runtime mishaps.

### Advanced Union Types: `Only` and `Either`

When you need to create types dynamically, TypeScript offers `Only` and `Either`
concepts. Think of them as your trusty sidekicks for handling complex type
scenarios.

#### `Only` Type: The Specialist

The `Only` type allows you to create a new type that retains only specific
properties from existing types while omitting others:

```typescript
type Only<T, U> = { [P in keyof T]: T[P] } & Omit<
	{ [P in keyof U]?: never },
	keyof T
>;

type CatOnly = Only<Cat, Dog>; // Results in { name: string; age: number; color: string; }
type DogOnly = Only<Dog, Cat>; // Results in { name: string; age: number; breed: string; }
```

In these examples, `Only` creates `CatOnly` and `DogOnly` types by focusing on
the properties unique to `Cat` and `Dog`, respectively.

#### `Either` Type: The Unifier

The `Either` type combines two types into a union where each property is present
in at least one of the original types:

```typescript
type Either<T, U> = Only<T, U> | Only<U, T>;

type Animal = Either<Cat, Dog>;
```

With `Either`, `Animal` becomes a union type that includes all properties from
both `Cat` and `Dog`, ensuring type safety across various scenarios where either
type might be valid.

### Conclusion

Union types and their advanced concepts like type guards, `Only`, and `Either`
are essential for handling varied data structures and ensuring type safety in
TypeScript applications. By leveraging these features, developers can write
robust and flexible code that adapts to dynamic type scenarios. So, go ahead,
embrace the power of TypeScript unions, and code with confidence!
